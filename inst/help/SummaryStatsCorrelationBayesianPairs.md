Summary Statistics Bayesian Correlation
==========

The Bayesian Correlation analysis allows you to test the null hypothesis that the population (Pearson product-moment correlation) between two variables equals 0.

### Input
---

#### Assignment Box
- *n*: Sample size (minimum: 2)

#### Sample Correlation coefficient
  - *Pearson's r*: The observed Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient
  - *Kendall's tau-b*: The observed Kendall's tau-b rank-order correlation coefficient.

#### Alt. Hypothesis
- *Correlated*: Two-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation does not equal 0.
- *Correlated positively*: One-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is higher than 0.
- *Correlated negatively*: One-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is lower than 0.

#### Bayes Factor
- *BF10*: Bayes factor to quantify evidence for the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis.
- *BF01*: Bayes factor to quantify evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the alternative hypothesis.
- *Log(BF10)*: Natural logarithm of BF10.

#### Plots
- *Prior and posterior*: Displays the prior (dashed line) and posterior (solid line) density of the correlation under the alternative hypothesis
  - *Estimation info*: Displays the median and 95% credible interval of the posterior density
  - *Testing info*: Displays the Bayes factor; displays a probability wheel depicting the odds of the data under the null vs. alternative hypothesis; displays gray circles that represent the height of the prior and the posterior density at the testing point (rho=0). The ratio of the two densities at that point is equal to the Bayes factor.
- *Bayes factor robustness plot*: Displays the Bayes factor as a function of the width of the Cauchy prior on effect size. The scale of the Cauchy prior is varied between 0 and 1.5 (between 0 and 2 if user prior width is greater than 1.5), creating progressively more uninformative priors.
  - *Additional info*: Displays the maximum Bayes factor in favor of the alternative hypothesis and the user Bayes factor.

#### Prior
*Stretched Beta prior width*: Default is 1

### Output
---
#### Bayesian Pearson Correlations
- **Bayes factor**: If one-sided test is requested:
  - BF+0: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is higher than 0
  - BF-0: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is lower than 0
  - BF0+: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is higher than 0
  - BF0-: Bayes factor that quantifies evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the one-sided alternative hypothesis that the population correlation is lower than 0
- **p**: p-value corresponding to t-statistic.
